- 👋 Hi, I’m @MarkVerbeek91
- 👀 I’m interested in Clean Coding (Python/c/c++/rust/haskell/etc), LEGO Technick, Robotics, Rendering, and automation of almost everything. Ow, and I know physiscs too! 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to be an even better Software Engineer.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source in general. 
- 📫 How to reach me ... not sure yet. Probably Linkedin is the best channel.
